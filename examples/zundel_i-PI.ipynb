For that we will use a communication socket run by i-Pi, which basically outputs a structure produced by the MD and gives it in input to Librascal. This will in turn return energies, forces and stresses by means of the `GenericMDCalculator` class of Librascal. \n",

    "The job itself will generate a parent process (i-Pi) which contains information of the ensemble, the step needed for the time-integration, the thermostat characteristics, and all other trajectory-related infos. All these information are initially stored in an input.xml file as specified in the i-Pi documentation at https://github.com/cosmo-epfl/i-pi and given as inputs to i-Pi. The Librascal calculator is then launched as a child process and exchanges information with the MD driver.  \n",

This simulation gives as output a .out file containing the time-evolution of all the relevant physical quantities, while the .xc.xyz file contains the full trajectory, which you can later visualize with VMD. The file `h5o2+.xyz` is both used by i-PI as a starting configuration of the trajectory and by Librascal as a template to load information about chemical species and number of atoms per species of the system.\n",
